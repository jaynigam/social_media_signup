social mdeia signup with hybridigniter

Hello guys, 
     This is social media signup application for user authentication.
     I have used hybridigniter, a plugin to connect to any social networking site easily.
     What you guys need to do is add your api key and secret key to hybridauthlib file in config folder
     and use the controller upto the extent you want and you will be good to go.
     
  NOTE : If you guys are working on localhost and your twitter application is not working fine then 
  add 127.0.0.1 to your callback url in twitter developers console and reload your application.
  
  
                              HAPPY CODING!!!
